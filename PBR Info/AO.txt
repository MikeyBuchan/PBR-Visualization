Ambient Occlusion(AO) is a shading and rendering technique used to calculate how exposed each point in the scene is to the world light.
The interior of a tube is typically more occluded (and hence darker) than the exposed outer surfaces, and the deeper you go inside the tube, the more occluded (and darker) the lighting becomes.





The ambient occlusion map defines how much of the ambient environment lighting is accessible to a surface point.
It only affects the diffuse contribution and should not occlude the specular contribution.
Some engines, such as Unreal Engine 4, have an option for screen space reflection to simulate local reflections.
The best combination is to use AO with screen space reflections.
