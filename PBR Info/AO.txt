Ambient Occlusion(AO) is a shading and rendering technique used to calculate how exposed each point in the scene is to the world light.
The interior of a tube is typically more occluded (and hence darker) than the exposed outer surfaces, and the deeper you go inside the tube, the more occluded (and darker) the lighting becomes.
