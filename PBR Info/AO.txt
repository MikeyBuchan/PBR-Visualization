Ambient Occlusion(AO) is a shading and rendering technique used to calculate how exposed each point in the scene is to the world light.
The interior of a tube is typically more occluded (and hence darker) than the exposed outer surfaces, and the deeper you go inside the tube, the more occluded (and darker) the lighting becomes.





The ambient occlusion map defines how much of the ambient environment lighting is accessible to a surface point.
It only affects the diffuse contribution and should not occlude the specular contribution.
Some engines, such as Unreal Engine 4, have an option for screen space reflection to simulate local reflections.
The best combination is to use AO with screen space reflections.


The occlusion map is used to provide information about which areas of the model should receive high or low indirect lighting. 
Indirect lighting comes from ambient lighting and reflections, and so steep concave parts of your model such as a crack or fold would not realistically receive much indirect light.
Occlusion texture maps are normally calculated by 3D applications directly from the 3D model using the modeller or third party software.
An occlusion map is a greyscale image, with white indicating areas that should receive full indirect lighting, and black indicating no indirect lighting. 
Sometimes this is as simple as a greyscale heightmap, for simple surfaces (such as the knobbly stone wall texture shown in the heightmap example above).

At other times, generating the correct occlusion texture is slightly more complex. For example, if a character in your scene
is wearing a hood, the inside edges of the hood should be set to very low indirect lighting, or none at all. In these situations, 
occlusion maps will be often be produced by artists, using 3D applications to automatically generate an occlusion map based on the model.
