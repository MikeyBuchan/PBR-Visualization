A Normal map is a type of map where you can add a small detail to your object. 
It is a special kind of texture that allows you to add surface detail such as bumps, grooves, and scratches to a model which catch the light as if they are represented by real geometry.




The best combination is to use AO with screen space reflections.
It is an RGB map where each component corresponds to the X, Y and Z coordinates of the surface normal.
It can be used to store the projected details of a high-resolution model to a low-resolution model.

Normal mapping takes this modification of surface normals one step further, by using a texture to store information about how to modify the surface normals across the model. 
A normal map is an image texture mapped to the surface of a model, similar to regular colour textures, however each pixelin the texture of the normal map (called a texel) 
represents a deviation in surface normal direction away from the “true” surface normal of the flat (or smooth interpolated) polygon.
In this diagram, which is again a 2D representation of three polygons on the surface of a 3D model, each orange arrow corresponds to a pixel in the normalmap texture. 
Below, is a single-pixel slice of a normalmap texture. In the centre, you can see the normals have been modified, giving the appearance of a couple of bumps on the 
surface of the polygon. These bumps would only be apparent due to the way lighting appears on the surface, because these modified normals are used in the lighting calculations.
The colours visible in a raw normal map file typically have a blueish hue, and don’t contain any actual light or dark shading - this is because the colours themselves are not 
intended to be displayed as they are. 
Instead, the RGB values of each texel represent the X,Y & Z values of a direction vector, and are applied as a modification to the basic interpolated smooth normals of the polygon surfaces.
