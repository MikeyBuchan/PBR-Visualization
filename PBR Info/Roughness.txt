This map controls the sharpness of the reflections.


The roughness map describes the surface irregularites that cause light diffusion.
The reflected direction will vary randomly based on the surface roughness.
This changes light direction, but the light intensity remains constant.
Rougher surfaces will have larger and dimmer-looking highlights.
Smoother surfaces will keep specular reflections focused, which can appear to look brighter or more intense even though the same total amount of light is reflected.
