A Normal map is a type of map where you can add a small detail to your object. 
It is a special kind of texture that allows you to add surface detail such as bumps, grooves, and scratches to a model which catch the light as if they are represented by real geometry.




The best combination is to use AO with screen space reflections.
It is an RGB map where each component corresponds to the X, Y and Z coordinates of the surface normal.
It can be used to store the projected details of a high-resolution model to a low-resolution model.
