A  metallic map is used to mimic metal characteristics.

You can use a Metallic map if you want a specific part made out of metal.



The metallic map is used to define which areas of a material denote raw metal.
As a grayscale map, it operates in a manner similar to a mask, as it tells the shader how it should interpret data found in the base color.
The data in the metallic map does not contain real-world data that is directly used as material value.
It simply describes to the shader which areas in the base color should be interpreted as reflected color and which areas denote metal reflectance values.
In the metallic map, 0.0(black) represents non-metal and 1.0(white) represents raw metal.
in terms of defining raw metal and non-metal, this metallic map is often binary: black or white, metal or non-metal.
In practice, when the shader looks at the metal map sees white, it then checks the corresponding areas in the base color map to get the reflectance values for the metal.
