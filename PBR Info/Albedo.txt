Albedo is the base color input, commonly known as a diffuse map.

An albedo map defines the color of diffused light. 
One of the biggest differences between an albedo map in a PBR system and a traditional diffuse map is the lack of directional light or ambient occlusion. 
Directional light will look incorrect in certain lighting conditions, and ambient occlusion should be added in the separate AO slot.
